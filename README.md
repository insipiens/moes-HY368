# moes-HY368

For those wanting to use rechargable batteries, this is my latest solution - using buck voltage converter. Works well on the HY368 from Moes

converters bought here: https://www.aliexpress.com/i/33050378063.html

solder in the ground and Vin (over length) wires to the converter before fitting, 

desolder the positive wire from the battery terminal on the right and solder that to the converter Vo. 

Then trim the ground lead and Vin from the converter to suit and connect to the ground junction and battery +ve terminal (which can be removed from the case to make it easier).

A fine solder tip is useful....

A greener solution than using dry cell batteries, and less low battery alerts when using NiCad or NiMH batteries!

*note: converters pull some current continually...maybe more efficient converters can be found.

Also alternative forms of rechargable batteries could be used with the AA form. Ni-Zn batteries have been mentioned. I have not used these so no idea if they have any limitations over Ni-MH chemistry
